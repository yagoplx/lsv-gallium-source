yagoply is not a professional programmer. The Gallium server is a project done only for the
purpose of learning and fun. This is why I (yagoply) don't want anyone's money to get involved
in the Lastsnap Vanilla server's development.

-- Description --

datapacks -> Datapacks used in the Lastsnap Vanilla server.

kernel -> Contains a list of Linux patchsets used in the Gallium server's kernel

scripts -> Contains scripts used for management of the Lastsnap Vanilla server by the root user, usually through
the Toasted Watchdog Framework, and other miscellaneous utilities for management of the Gallium server (the machine everything runs on)
and the Gallium router (the subsystem that handles networking). Not many WiFi-related solutions are included. Most of these are meant to be
used on a schedule with crontab (gallium uses cronie)

tweak -> Tweaks to the core of the system (the kernel) done at runtime. Contains the Gallium server's startup script, a script to setup
bufferbloat mitigations on the network, and /etc/sysctl.conf

twf -> The Toasted Watchdog Framework, deprived of its easy-installation part, that was used to dumb down its deployment in the
community it was born (Fully Toasted, and their Minecraft servers). TWF allows the system to communicate with and control Minecraft servers of
any version through the Linux terminal multiplexer (tmux) and console. Very useful for automation, also functions as an auto-reboot script,
which was its original purpose. None of the TWF code belongs to Fully Toasted (even though they have a version of it full of copyright notices).
